Full stack web engineer with the following specialties: </p>\n  <ul class="list">\n    <li class="button" markdown="1">JavaScript</li>\n    <li class="button" markdown="1">React</li>\n    <li class="button" markdown="1">Ruby</li>\n    <li class="button" markdown="1">Ruby on Rails</li>\n    <li class="button" markdown="1">HTML</li>\n    <li class="button" markdown="1">Sass</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<p>Hi, I\'m Rhys, native to Australia but living abroad in Singapore. I have always been interested in IT. At high school I studied Software Design and Development, creating small programs with Visual Basic and multi page websites with Dreamweaver.</p>\n<p>I\'m an qualified electrician with over ten years experience in the trade, working as part of a team to deliver major new capital infrastructure investments such as the Kooragang 132kV substation. Recently I have been helping roll out advanced interval meters as part of the Australian Energy Market Operators reforms to the Australian energy network.</p>\n<p>Although I really enjoyed my work, I decided to seek further challenges and began to learn web development online with TheOdinProject.com. After a few weeks I was hooked and rediscovered my passion for coding. Setting up a development environment and working on my own computer was great fun, and pushing the code to GitHub to share with the open source community for feedback was a thrill.</p>\n<p>I am passionate about building beautiful websites, incorporating multiple languages into my workflow, implementing creative solutions for challenging problems, and most of all being able to make a difference. I have been practicing and honing my skills for over two years, focusing on the Ruby on Rails and React frameworks whilst working hard on Ruby and JavaScript to have a solid foundation of the basic programming skills.</p>\n<h2 markdown="1" style="text-align: left;">Hobbies and Interests</h2>\n<p>I\'m an active moderator on The Odin Project, helping to add features to the Rails application and keeping the curriculum up to date. I create pull requests to close issues and plan new features on the Trello board. I review and merge pull requests in order to keep the site up to date and secure.</p>\n<div class="article-image" markdown="1">\n  <img class="image" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/dbj3qsde8a1y/39TPldBhQcyYkAQgEyucsQ/ea6b056c9eaf2705603bfbbd2f55517e/solo.jpg?" alt="Rhys in Bell 47" markdown="1">\n  <p class="quote" markdown="1">Bell 47 VH-UTF after first solo. Slow, smooth and comfortable, the perfect helicopter to learn rotary wing flying.</p>\n</div>\n<p>My other great passion apart from coding is my love of flying. I hold dual Australian licences for fixed wing and rotary aircraft. My first lessons were on a Cessna 140 manufactured in 1946, a rugged and simple aircraft. I enjoyed the challenge immensely, exploring new parts of the country along the way with many lessons learn, particularly the importance of meticulous planning on navigation exercises.</p>\n<p>After gaining my fixed wing licence I moved onto Helicopters to achieve my life long dream. Having already somewhat mastered the basics in the Cessna, the learning curve was still steep but very enjoyable. </p>\n<h2 markdown="1" style="text-align: left;">Get in Touch</h2>\n<p>Please be one of those people and find me online and say hi!
